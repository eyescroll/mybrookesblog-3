When we think of a signature, we associate it with an act of self-identification that can signify a commitment, authorization or simply leaving one’s mark on the world. This flick of the wrist can be the bridge between vital legalisations, the completion of an artist’s work, or the approval of a cheque. Regardless of how it is applied to an individual’s day to day life, a signature is, and has for millenniums, been an integral part to civilisation and the melting pot that we call history.

 

But what is in a signature? The quickest point of reference for me is to write my own down on a piece of paper, and as I do so there is something that immediately stands out to me. This being the horizontal line that I, in an act of second nature, drag through all my ‘t’s and the end of writing my full name. This was something that I decided over a decade ago when at the bank with my mother getting my first debit card. 

 

‘Remember to make it personal to you darling’, my mother warned and she was right.

 

Making it personal is the most essential part of a signature, that has for everyone, in particular public figures, been a crucial facet of their identity or persona. As it not only makes them identifiable and memorable, but also immortalises them.  

 

Take Pablo Picasso’s for example, nearly as recognisable as his art, his signature can be traced back to him, not simply because of the literal name written, but also because of its style. The thick luscious letters, with the almost melting ‘e’ and assertive underline, serves to highlight Picasso’s artistic sensibility. Whilst also ultimately contributing to the idea of immediate association via visual stimulus that is so prevalent throughout his work.

Likewise, with John Hancock’s flamboyant signature on the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the instantly distinguishable style, like Picasso’s, has meant that it, out of the fifty-six congressional delegates that signed the document, is the one that people remember. So much so that “John Hancock” became, in the US, an informal synonym for signature.

Therefore, just with these two examples, we can see that similar to a brand’s logo, an individual’s signature is part of their own brand and an extension of their identity. Like with a brand, the influence of the logo, or in this case a signature, is not merely down to the documents they sign and consequently the actions they sanction. But also the way it impacts customer experience and subsequently consumer rates. Essentially, signing causes consumers to become more engaged when shopping and more closely identify with the brand itself. Just in the same way having a wanted brand makes you feel part of a club, the act of signing carries a sense of exclusivity. 

 

In this way, aren’t we all just part of a club where the entrance fee is our own unique hand written password.
